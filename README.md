Spear
=====

Spear is a simple 3D game framework I have been working on since I started learning Haskell, and is therefore more of a "let's see where I can get to" kind of project.

The project's goal is to put what I learn into practise, to explore how far I can get with Haskell and if the results are decent enough, to build one or two game demos along the way.

Installation
------------

Simply clone the repo and build with cabal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jeannekamikaze/Spear.git
cd Spear
cabal install
```

Documentation
-------------

An online copy of the haddocks can be found [here][0].
